Stock Portfolio Tracker
üí° Project Description

This is a simple Python-based Stock Portfolio Tracker developed as part of the Python Programming Internship at CodeAlpha.
The program allows users to manually input stock names and their quantities. Using predefined stock prices (hardcoded), it calculates the total investment value and optionally saves the summary to a .txt file.

It‚Äôs a beginner-friendly tool that demonstrates the use of dictionaries, input/output, loops, and basic file handling in Python.

‚öôÔ∏è Features

Option to save the portfolio summary to a text file.

üîë Key Concepts Used
